# metar-printer
This is a simple QT application to query METAR reports and spit them out to a printer. I'm using an [Epson TM-T20II](https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/POS/TM-T20II-POS-Receipt-Printer/p/C31CD52062)

Some default values are tuned to this printer, and should be made configurable.

Relies on libcurl.
